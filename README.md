# RetrofitWeatherApp

What this app does:

Enter city and press search button.
It will display weather forcast for upcoming days including today.
While the API request is in flight, the UI displays an indicator(Progress bar) that the request is being made.
If the user enters an invalid city (one that the API does not recognize), an error will be displayed.
The list of upcoming weather can be scrolled if needed and display however many days, the API provides via an adapter-based view.
The UI properly handles rotation.
